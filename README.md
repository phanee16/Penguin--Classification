# Goal of the project :
To classify the penguins species using Support Vector Machines

# About SVM: 
A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems.

# About the dataset:
The dataset contains different body measurements for three species of penguins from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.<br>
It has 344 instances and 8 columns. <br>

The dataset consists of the following features: <br>
1. species 
2. island 
3. culmen measurements : (i) bill/culmen length (ii) bill/culmen depth
4. flipper length
5. body mass
6. sex
7. year<br>
In this data, every row is a unique observation (an individual penguin). For each penguin, you have the species of the penguin, which island it lives on, its sex, the year the measurements were taken, and some body size measurements.
